# Panera_Coffee
Free Panera coffee at the click of a button (for summer 2020). This is a simple selenium script meant to demonstrate how to interact with chromium web browser.

## Getting Started

Create account at [panera](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html) and enter credit information. Panera has waived the fee for the summer, but still requires you to make a subscription account––which requires your credit card. After you enter this you can cancel your subscription (immediately) and continue the benefits of free coffee for the summer.

### Prerequisites

```
pip install selenium
```

### Installing

Download zip repo and unzip your specific chromedriver zip file

## Execution

python3 main.py --username <your paner email> --password <your panera password>

## Liability

Use this repo at your own risk. I do not assume liability in any way for this program; it is a simple demonstration of Selenium technology, used to order a coffee from Panera. This project was created independent of [Panera Bread](www.panerabread.com).
